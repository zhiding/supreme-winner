About paris_6k_{}_weights_{epoch}_{val_acc}.h5:
  all_batchnorm: batch normalization layer follows every conv layer
  part_batchnorm: batch normalization layer only follows conv layer in block 4 and block 5
  batchnorm: batch normalization layer only follows conv layer in block 5
  finetune: training last conv block and fc layers

Results of val_acc:
  all_batchnorm: 68.87% at the 24th epoch
  part_batchnorm: 69.30% at the 28th epoch
  batchnorm: 70.08% at the 21st epoch
  finetune: 70.51% at the 39th epoch


Since I mistake nb_class as 12 which actually is 11, excluding `general` folder,
I run training on second time.

New results of val_acc:
  finetune  : half lr at the 23th(24th) epoch,  
              get best acc 77.33% at the 9th(10th) epoch
  last_bn   : half lr at the 7th(8th) epoch,
              get best acc 81.38% at the 3rd(4th) epoch
  last2nd_bn: get best acc 81.56% at the 24th(25th) epoch
  all_bn    : half lr first time at 14th(15th) epoch, 
              half lr second time at 21st(22nd) epoch,
              get best acc 80.34% at 26th(27th) epoch
